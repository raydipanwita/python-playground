# python-on-exercism

This repo contains my journey of learning Python via the wonderful exercism platform!

## Prerequisite:

- download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## How to run:

Use `main.py` to run call any function, from any module.

```python
from basics.lasagna import *

def main():
    print(bake_time_remaining(5))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
